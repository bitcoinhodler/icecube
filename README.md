# icecube
A Linux distro tailored for the Glacier protocol

About icecube.

Icecube is a Bash script that generates a USB with a bootable Debian based Linux distro that is tailored for the glacier protocol.

How to use it. 

Icecube is supposed to be run on a Ubuntu system. Plug a USB key into your system, and run the bash script with the path to the usb device as a command line parameter. After (successful)
execution you should have a bootable USB running a bare Debian Linux with bitcoin core and glacier installed on the system.

Why us it? 

Except for simplifying the protocol procedure a bit, icecube will also enable RAM-only boot, which will make the boot USB key removable and hence offer a slightly higher level of security.

Should I use it? 

No. At this point icecube is a purely experimental project and should in no way be used for any serious purpose.
